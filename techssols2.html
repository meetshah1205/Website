        <h1>Now lets talk about how Hackers hack your computer using their passwords and Hashes.</h1> <br>
        <h2>The entire process will be documented here and I will also show you how to defend against it.</h2><br>
        <h2>So basically the Hacker needs just a Kali Linux computer (or sometimes even a <u><a style="color: blue;"
                    class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine">Virtual Machine)</a> </u> </h2><br>
        <h2>Linux is sometimes considered a programmers and hackers only operating system. Which nobody knows why.</h2>
        <div class="bigfont1">
            Now Disclaimer: <br>
            The things showed/discussed from now is a real hacking technique. So even if you decide to use it on someone
            (ethically) please make sure you have explicit permission and are following all the rules.
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>So let's assume the Hacker(s) has the access to your Windows Computer, but he or she is too greedy to just
            have it once. So what will he do? Buy your computer? OF COURSE NOT. Hack it? Yes, that's what a sigma do.
            Please do not take it seriously.</p>

        <br>

        <p>So let's continue without anymore time-waste.</p>

        <p>So let's you have a password in your Windows Computer, which is a very good thing.</p>
        <p>Windows doesn't just your passwords in plain text form. </p>
        <p>It is stored in the form of something called <b class="yellow">HASH</b>. </p>
        <p>If you don't what a <b class="yellow">HASH</b> is, read this <u><a style="color: blue;"
                   class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function"><i> Wikipedia Article </i> </u></a> </p>

        <p>For the sake of education we will assume that your password is:</p>
        <p class="yellow">Sup3rs3RETP@@$$word</p>
        <p>Which is a good password and indicated that you used some kind of password generator to generate this. Even
            then you will be hacked.</p>
        <p>After you set this password, it will be went through a hashing algorithm. Which in this case is: <br>
        <p class="yellow">MD4 Hashing algorithm</b> after which it will look like somebody chewed and spat out.
        </p>
        <p>After hashing the password will look something like this: <br></p>
        <p class="hash">ca0a1e55c19606f471a5b3ecf8054271</p>
        <p>So whenever you type in the password it will again go through the <b class="yellow">MD4 Hashing algorithm</b>
            and if the hashes match, you will login.</p>

        <p>This hash is what the hacker needs to get into your Computer from his.</p>
        <p>While it would not immediately tell the hacker what the hash is, it will, the hacker will crack it.</p>
        <p>Actually not entirely the hacker because he will need some softwares.</p>
        <p>Now lets talk about the process through which the Hacker will get the hash, and break into your computer.</p>
        <ul>
            <br>
            <!-- <br>
            <br> -->
            <li>Get access to your system once.</li>
            <p>He or she will need the access to your computer atleast once to get the files needed from your computer
                to get the hash.</p>
            <p>After getting physical access to your computer once, he will try his or her best to get the files as
                quickly as possible.</p>
            <br>
            <li>Get the files</li>
            <p>He will search for <b class="yellow">Resgistry Editor</b></p>
            <p>He will get the UAC prompt saying that <b class="yellow">"Do you want to allow this applcation to make
                    changes to your system?"</b> which you might also get while installing anything on your Windows
                machine. On which the hacker will click yes.</p>
            <p>He will ofcource just click yes. Luckily for him, you are the administrator on your system.</p>
            <p>Then he will go to <b class="yellow">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</b>.</p>
            <p>There he will see files or folders called <b class="yellow">SAM</b> and <b class="yellow">SYSTEM</b>.</p>
            <p>Lets say he does it with the <b class="yellow">command prompt</b>.</p>
            <p>After in <b class="yellow">CMD</b> he will type the following command to get the sam file:</p>
            <div class="sqlq">
                $ <span class="yellow">reg</span> <span class="grey">save HKLM\sam ./sam.save</span>
            </div>
            <p>And this one to get the systme file:</p>
            <div class="sqlq">
                $ <span class="yellow">reg</span> <span class="grey">save HKLM\system ./system.save</span>
            </div>

            <br>

            <li>Get the files in a flash drive.</li>
            <p>He will get the flash drive, plug it in your computer and copy (or cut) the files and paste it into the
                flash drive.</p>
        </ul>
        <br><br><br>
        <h3 style="font-size: 27px;">Now that he has the files needed to get the hash, he will go back to his Kali Linux
            Machine.</h3>
        <br><br>
        <ul>
            <li>Plug the flash drive into his computer.</li>
            <p>Does it even need to be explained? Isn't it so clear that he pluged it into his computer.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <li>Unpack the files to get hash</li>
            <p>The tool generally used to grab the hash out of <b class="yellow">SAM</b> and <b
                    class="yellow">SYSTEM</b> files is called <b class="yellow"><i>impacket-secretsdump</i></b>, that is
                a very wierd name. It is built into Kali Linux.</p>
            <p>If the hacker isn't using Kali, he will type in this command in the terminal to get it:</p>
             <div class="sqlq">
            $ <span class="blue">sudo</span> <span class="cyan">apt</span> search impacket
            </div>
            <p>Then he install it with this command:</p>
             <div class="sqlq">
            $ <span class="blue">sudo</span> <span class="cyan">apt install</span> impacket
            </div>
            <br>
            <br>
            <li>Get the hash</li>
            <p>To get the hash, he will run this command:</p>
            <div class="sqlq">
                $ <span class="cyan">impacket-secretsdump -sam</span> sam.save <span class="cyan">-system</span>
                system.save LOCAL
            </div>
            <p>And there goes your Hash.</p>
            <p>He got your Hash in three-four lines of termianl.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <li>Crack the password</li>
            <p>Generally in older times Hackers used <i class="grey">Brute Force Attacks</i> which means keep guessing
                passwords until they get it correct. But this method is useless after mordern password-generators became
                popular, as they had no pattern and the passwords were very random.</p>
            <p>If you want a good password generator I have one that I made, it is totally safe and the passwords are
                very random.</p>
            <a class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4" href="./main.html">Try it out your self.</a>
            <p>The hacker will need a list of passwords that could be your password. Probably 20,000 passwords, 50,000
                passwords, 100,000 passwords. Unluckily or Luckily there are tools that can automate that.</p>
            <p>Now he will use a tool called <b><i class="yellow">CUPP</i></b> to get the hash and see what is happening
                on the screen of the target.</p>
          <br>
          <br>
                <li>Use <i class="yellow">CUPP</i> to get your password through your details.</li>
            <p>He will use <i class="yellow">CUPP</i> to get your password through your Name, IP, Birthdate and other
                things to get your passwords and see the things happening on your screen.</p>
            <div class="sqlq">
              $  cupp -i
            </div>
            <p>Now he will type your details to get your passwords.</p>
            <p>They will ask for your Full Name, Birthdate, Wife's name, child's name, company name etc.</p>
            <p>Then <i class="yellow">CUPP</i> will generate a list of passwords that could be your password.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <li>Now try to get your password from the list of passwords.</li>
            <p>There is a very popular tool for this called <b><u><i class="yellow">hashcat</i></u></b>.</p>
            <p>He will now use hashcat to get your password.</p>
            <div class="sqlq">
                $ <span class="blue">sudo</span> <span class="cyan">hashcat -m</span> 1000 <b>hash.txt
                    listofpasswords.txt</b>
            </div>
            <p>1000 is NTLM algorithm that Windows uses. hash.txt is the file that has the hash of the Windows computer.
                listofpasswords.txt is the list of passwords <i class="yellow">CUPP</i> generated.</p>
            <p>Now he will see that the Status of password is <span class="red">CRACKED</span>.</p>
            <p>Now he will use this command to show the password:</p>
            <div class="sqlq">
                $ <span class="blue">sudo</span> <span class="cyan">hashcat -m</span> 1000 <b>hash.txt
                    listofpasswords.txt</b> <span class="cyan">--show</span>
            </div>
            <p>Now he will have the Hash and the password. Now all that is left to do is see the things happening on
                your screen.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <li>EVIL-WINRM</li>
            <p>Evil-WINRM is a tool often used in cybersecurity assesments and penetration testing. It leverages the
                WINRM protocol to exploit potential vulnerabilities in Windows Systems. </p>
            <p>He will type this command to get access to your PowerShell and Eventually your screen.</p>
            <div class="sqlq">
                $ <span class="cyan">evil-winrm -i</span> yo.ur.ip.addr <span class="cyan">-u</span> yourusername <span
                    class="cyan">-p</span> thecrackedpassword
            </div>
            <p>That gave the hacker the access to your systme's PowerShell.</p>
            <p>Now the access to your screen.</p>
            <div class="sqlq">
                $ <span class="cyan">xfreedp</span> /v: yo.ur.ip.addr /u: yourusername /p: thecrackedpassword
            </div>
            <p>Now let's talk about the ways that hacker can get to your PowerShell with just the Hash with this
                command:</p>
            <div class="sqlq">
                $ <span class="cyan">evil-winrm -i</span> yo.ur.ip.addr <span class="cyan">-u</span> yourusername <span
                    class="cyan">-H</span> thehashgotfromthefiles
            </div>

            <p>Another thing that can be used to getcthe screen access without password with <b><i class="yellow">Pass
                        The Hash Algorithm</i></b></p>
            <div class="sqlq">
                $ <span class="cyan">xfreedp</span> /v: yo.ur.ip.addr /u: yourusername /pth: thehashgotfromthefiles
            </div>
        </ul>
        <div style="font-size: 29px; color: #ff0000;" class="paras">

        <div>Now lets talk about how you can defend your devices from this.</div>
        <div>Here are a few examples of defence ideas and protocols against Windows Password Hacking.</div>
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Switch to another OS.</li>
            <p>As Windows is so unsafe to use and takes a lot of ram and storage for just a fancy UI and features you will never use. That is the reason why many big tech companies use OS like MacOS or Linux etc.</p>
            <p>There are alot of different distros of Linux like the most beginner friendly one <b style="color: orange;">Ubuntu</b> or <b style="color: #0090ff; font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif; font-weight: 590;">fedora</b> and MacOS is also an option if you can afford it.</p>
            <br>
            <li>Hope</li>
            <p>This is not a good option. Still you can hope 😊.</p>
