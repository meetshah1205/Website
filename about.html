<h2>
    CyberGaurdian is a website made by a solo 12 year old developer from India, so the styling, content, technique etc. could be bad, but I am just 12 year old while making this 16/12/2023. 
    CyberGaurdian is open source and I will merge pull requests if I think the content they added is valid and follows the theme of the website. <u><a href="https://github.com/meetshah1205/Website">Source code can be found here.</a></u>
</h2>
<div class="info">
    All the information took for this website is purely form open source sources. Mainly from the famous Youtuber <a href="https://youtube.com/networkchuck"><u style="color: blue;">NetworkChuck</u></a> and <a href="https://chat.openai.com"><u style="color: blue;">ChatGPT.</u></a>
    This is not to harm anyone's feelings or promoting Hacking in any manner. 
    CyberGaurdian is made entirely without JavaScript only JavaScript used in this entire website is in the password-generator in Windows Password Hacking page where there was my <a href="./main.html">Passsword Generator</a>. This is all just HTML, CSS and a bit of TailWind CSS at some places.
